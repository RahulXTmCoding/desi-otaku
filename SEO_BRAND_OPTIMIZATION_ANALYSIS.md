## Issues Identified That Match Your Problem üîç

### 1. **Brand Authority Signals - WEAK** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current Title**: "Attars Club - Premium Fashion India | Attars"

**Issues**:

- Generic fashion description doesn't establish brand authority
- Missing strong brand declaration

### 2. **Domain Authority Challenge** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Your Domain**: attars.club (.club TLD)
**Problem**: Google often prioritizes .com domains and established sites

**Contributing Factors**:

- Newer domain without established backlink profile
- "Attars" is a generic word (perfumes/oils) causing semantic confusion

### 3. **Brand vs Generic Word Confusion** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: "Attars" has multiple meanings
- **Generic**: Traditional perfumes/essential oils (very common search)
- **Your Brand**: Attars Club fashion brand

**Current Risk**: Google may show perfume sites instead of your brand

### 4. **Weak Brand Schema Signals** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current Schema**: Basic organization markup
**Missing**: Strong brand claims, official website designation, brand entity signals
