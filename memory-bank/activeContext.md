- Deployment and infrastructure planning

## Phase 3: Custom Design System (In Progress)

### Completed in Current Phase:
1. **T-Shirt Preview Components** ✅
   - Created multiple preview implementations:
     - `TShirtPreview.tsx` - Basic preview with color selection
     - `SimpleTShirtPreview.tsx` - SVG-based realistic preview
     - `PhotoRealisticPreview.tsx` - Canvas-based photo-realistic preview with mockups
   - T-shirt mockup data structure with base64 SVG images
   - Color filter system for different t-shirt colors
   - Front/back view toggle functionality

2. **Customize Page Enhancement** ✅
   - Integrated with new preview components
   - Design selection from product catalog
   - Real-time preview updates
   - Color and size selection
   - Price calculation with design fees
   - Mobile responsive layout

### In Progress:
1. **Advanced Design Editor Features**
   - Canvas-based design manipulation
   - Design positioning and sizing
   - Multiple design placement options
   - Save/load functionality for custom designs

## Previously Completed Features

### Phase 2: Core E-commerce ✅
1. **Enhanced Shopping Cart UI**
   - Slide-out CartDrawer component
   - Real-time quantity updates
   - Free shipping threshold

2. **Multi-step Checkout Flow**
   - EnhancedCheckout component
   - Progress indicators
   - Form validation

3. **Payment Integration**
   - Stripe payment processing
   - Payment webhook handling
   - Order status management

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions automation
   - Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend) deployment
   - Production-ready configuration

## Design System Implementation

### Dark Theme Palette (Active)
```css
Background Dark: #1F2937 (gray-800)
Background Darker: #111827 (gray-900)
Card Background: #374151 (gray-700)
Primary Yellow: #FCD34D (yellow-400)
Purple Gradient: #8B5CF6 to #6366F1
```

### Component Patterns
- Rounded corners (8px, 12px, 16px)
- Hover scale effects (1.05)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Yellow accent for CTAs and highlights

## Technical Implementation Details

### Custom Design System Architecture
```typescript
// T-shirt mockup structure
interface TShirtMockup {
  front: string; // Base64 SVG or image URL
  back: string;
}

// Design positioning
interface DesignPosition {
  x: number; // Percentage from left
  y: number; // Percentage from top
  width: number; // Percentage of t-shirt width
  height: number; // Percentage of t-shirt height
}

// Preview component props
interface PreviewProps {
  selectedColor: string;
  selectedDesign: Design | null;
  designUrl: string;
}
```

### Current Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- **State Management**: React Context + Local Storage
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API + Base64 encoding
- **Deployment**: Vercel + Render + GitHub Actions

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Continuation)

1. **Design Upload System**
   - File upload with validation
   - Image format support (PNG, JPG, SVG)
   - Size and resolution guidelines
   - Preview before upload

2. **Advanced Editing Tools**
   - Resize handles for designs
   - Rotation controls
   - Layer management
   - Text addition with fonts

3. **Save & Share Features**
   - User design library
   - Design templates
   - Social sharing
   - Design approval workflow

4. **Production Integration**
   - Print-ready file generation
   - Design validation for printing
   - Cost calculation based on complexity
   - Admin approval system

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Component-based architecture
- Reusable UI components with consistent styling
- Dark theme maintained throughout

### User Experience
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Real-time preview updates
- Clear visual feedback

### Development Workflow
- Test mode for development without backend
- Mock data for offline development
- Gradual feature rollout
- Continuous integration with automated deployment

## Current Focus
Implementing the custom design editor with real-time preview, building on the photo-realistic preview component foundation. The goal is to create an intuitive design experience that matches the anime aesthetic while maintaining technical robustness.
