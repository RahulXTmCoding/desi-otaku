# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implemented soft delete functionality for products
- Products can now be archived (soft deleted) instead of permanently deleted
- Added product restoration and permanent deletion features
- Updated admin interface to manage deleted products

## Recent Changes

### 1. Soft Delete Implementation
- Added soft delete fields to Product model:
  - `isDeleted`: Boolean flag for soft deleted products
  - `deletedAt`: Timestamp of deletion
  - `deletedBy`: Reference to admin who deleted
- Modified delete product to use soft delete by default
- Created new controllers:
  - `permanentlyDeleteProduct`: For permanent deletion (requires product to be soft deleted first)
  - `restoreProduct`: To restore soft deleted products
  - `getDeletedProducts`: To fetch deleted products with pagination
- Updated product listing endpoints to exclude soft deleted products by default
- Added `includeDeleted` query parameter for admin to optionally include deleted products

### 2. Admin Interface Updates
- Updated ManageProducts component with toggle between Active/Deleted views
- Active view shows archive button instead of delete
- Deleted view shows restore and permanent delete options
- Added visual indicators and confirmation dialogs
- Updated help text to explain soft delete behavior

### 3. Routes Added
- `DELETE /api/product/permanent/:productId/:userId` - Permanent deletion
- `PUT /api/product/restore/:productId/:userId` - Restore product
- `GET /api/products/deleted/:userId` - Get deleted products

### 4. Benefits of Soft Delete
- Preserves order history and analytics data
- Allows recovery of accidentally deleted products
- Maintains referential integrity in the database
- Better audit trail with deletion tracking

### 5. Admin Order Management (/admin/orders)
- Created comprehensive order management system with real-time filtering
- Implemented bulk status updates for multiple orders
- Added detailed order modal with complete information
- Added CSV export functionality
- Fixed transaction_id display bug
- Fixed product image rendering issues

### 6. Analytics Dashboard (/admin/analytics)
- Created full analytics dashboard with revenue metrics and visual charts
- Implemented sales overview cards (revenue, orders, avg order value)
- Added product performance tracking
- Added category breakdown analysis
- Implemented date range filtering (7d, 30d, 90d, custom)
- Connected to real-time MongoDB data

### 7. Product Types Management System
- Cleaned up ProductType model (removed unnecessary fields)
- Created admin management page at /admin/product-types
- Implemented full CRUD operations with drag-and-drop reordering
- Added links to Header navigation and Admin Dashboard
- Set up proper ProductType documents with name field

### 8. Dynamic Product Types Integration
- Shop page now uses server-side filtering with backend endpoint
- Created `/api/products/filtered` endpoint for proper server-side filtering
- AddProduct/UpdateProduct pages use dynamic product types from backend
- Backend filtering handles both migrated (ObjectId) and non-migrated (string) products

### 9. Server-Side Filtering Implementation
- Removed frontend filtering from Shop page (following best practices)
- Created ShopWithBackendFilters component that fetches filtered data from backend
- Implemented proper pagination with server-side data
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance of the new server-side filtering
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed product type data
- Add more advanced analytics features if needed
- Consider implementing real-time order status updates using WebSockets
- Add admin notifications when products are soft deleted/restored

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chose server-side filtering over frontend filtering for better performance and scalability
- Maintained backward compatibility for products with string productType values
- Used MongoDB's $or queries to handle multiple productType variations
- Implemented proper pagination to handle large product catalogs
- Soft delete preserves data integrity while allowing product removal from shop

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Server-side filtering for all data-heavy operations
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Backward compatibility when migrating data structures
- Component modularity with separate files for complex features
- Audit trails for critical operations (like product deletion)

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Server-side filtering is crucial for scalable e-commerce applications
- MongoDB's flexibility allows handling both old and new data structures simultaneously
- Proper TypeScript interfaces help catch potential issues early
- Breaking down complex components into smaller modules improves maintainability
- Analytics data should be computed on the backend for accuracy
- Soft delete pattern is essential for maintaining data integrity in e-commerce

## Technical Implementation Details

### Soft Delete Implementation
The soft delete pattern ensures:
1. Products remain in the database for historical reference
2. Order history and analytics remain intact
3. Products can be recovered if needed
4. Audit trail shows who deleted and when

### ProductType Filtering Solution
The main challenge was handling products that have:
1. String values like "t-shirt", "tshirt", "Classic T-Shirt"
2. ObjectId references to ProductType documents

Solution implemented:
- Created comprehensive OR conditions to match all variations
- Special handling for T-Shirt variations (most common product type)
- Used MongoDB's $type operator to differentiate between ObjectId and string fields
- Maintained backward compatibility while supporting new structure

### Scripts Created for Migration
1. `setupProductTypes.js` - Creates ProductType documents with proper fields
2. `checkProductTypes.js` - Checks current productType values in products
3. `migrateProductTypes.js` - Migrates products to use ObjectId references
4. `testProductTypeFilter.js` - Tests the filtering logic
5. `testSoftDelete.js` - Tests soft delete functionality

### API Endpoints Created
- `GET /api/products/filtered` - Server-side product filtering with pagination
- `DELETE /api/product/:productId/:userId` - Soft delete product
- `DELETE /api/product/permanent/:productId/:userId` - Permanent delete
- `PUT /api/product/restore/:productId/:userId` - Restore product
- `GET /api/products/deleted/:userId` - Get deleted products
- Supports: search, category, productType, price range, tags, sorting
- Returns paginated results with metadata
