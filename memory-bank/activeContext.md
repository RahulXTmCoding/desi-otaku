# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Successfully implemented Admin Order Management & Analytics with full backend integration
- Created ProductType management system with dynamic product types
- Fixed Shop page filtering to use server-side filtering (best practice)
- Resolved product type filtering issues for both migrated and non-migrated products

## Recent Changes

### 1. Admin Order Management (/admin/orders)
- Created comprehensive order management system with real-time filtering
- Implemented bulk status updates for multiple orders
- Added detailed order modal with complete information
- Added CSV export functionality
- Fixed transaction_id display bug
- Fixed product image rendering issues

### 2. Analytics Dashboard (/admin/analytics)
- Created full analytics dashboard with revenue metrics and visual charts
- Implemented sales overview cards (revenue, orders, avg order value)
- Added product performance tracking
- Added category breakdown analysis
- Implemented date range filtering (7d, 30d, 90d, custom)
- Connected to real-time MongoDB data

### 3. Product Types Management System
- Cleaned up ProductType model (removed unnecessary fields)
- Created admin management page at /admin/product-types
- Implemented full CRUD operations with drag-and-drop reordering
- Added links to Header navigation and Admin Dashboard
- Set up proper ProductType documents with name field

### 4. Dynamic Product Types Integration
- Shop page now uses server-side filtering with backend endpoint
- Created `/api/products/filtered` endpoint for proper server-side filtering
- AddProduct/UpdateProduct pages use dynamic product types from backend
- Backend filtering handles both migrated (ObjectId) and non-migrated (string) products

### 5. Server-Side Filtering Implementation
- Removed frontend filtering from Shop page (following best practices)
- Created ShopWithBackendFilters component that fetches filtered data from backend
- Implemented proper pagination with server-side data
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance of the new server-side filtering
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed product type data
- Add more advanced analytics features if needed
- Consider implementing real-time order status updates using WebSockets

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chose server-side filtering over frontend filtering for better performance and scalability
- Maintained backward compatibility for products with string productType values
- Used MongoDB's $or queries to handle multiple productType variations
- Implemented proper pagination to handle large product catalogs

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Server-side filtering for all data-heavy operations
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Backward compatibility when migrating data structures
- Component modularity with separate files for complex features

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Server-side filtering is crucial for scalable e-commerce applications
- MongoDB's flexibility allows handling both old and new data structures simultaneously
- Proper TypeScript interfaces help catch potential issues early
- Breaking down complex components into smaller modules improves maintainability
- Analytics data should be computed on the backend for accuracy

## Technical Implementation Details

### ProductType Filtering Solution
The main challenge was handling products that have:
1. String values like "t-shirt", "tshirt", "Classic T-Shirt"
2. ObjectId references to ProductType documents

Solution implemented:
- Created comprehensive OR conditions to match all variations
- Special handling for T-Shirt variations (most common product type)
- Used MongoDB's $type operator to differentiate between ObjectId and string fields
- Maintained backward compatibility while supporting new structure

### Scripts Created for Migration
1. `setupProductTypes.js` - Creates ProductType documents with proper fields
2. `checkProductTypes.js` - Checks current productType values in products
3. `migrateProductTypes.js` - Migrates products to use ObjectId references
4. `testProductTypeFilter.js` - Tests the filtering logic

### API Endpoints Created
- `GET /api/products/filtered` - Server-side product filtering with pagination
- Supports: search, category, productType, price range, tags, sorting
- Returns paginated results with metadata
