# Active Context

## Recently Completed Tasks (January 2025)

### 1. Soft Delete Feature for Products ✅
### 2. Custom Design Data Flow Fix ✅

## Current Status: All Tasks Complete
No active development tasks. System is stable with all features working correctly.

### Recent Implementations

1. **Soft Delete for Products**
   - Products have `isDeleted` field (default: false)
   - Admin can soft delete products (marking them as deleted)
   - Soft deleted products remain in database for analytics and order history
   - Admin can view and restore soft deleted products
   - Option for permanent deletion from admin dashboard
   - API endpoints updated to filter out deleted products from public views

2. **Front & Back Custom Design Support**
   - Users can add designs to front, back, or both sides of t-shirts
   - Position selection for each side:
     - Front: center, left chest, right chest, center-bottom
     - Back: center, center-bottom
   - CartTShirtPreview component handles multi-side designs with rotation toggle
   - Design positions render correctly across all components
   - Order details show custom designs with F/B indicators

### Key Components Updated

1. **Server Side**:
   - `server/models/product.js` - Added isDeleted field
   - `server/controllers/product.js` - Soft delete logic
   - `server/routes/product.js` - Delete/restore endpoints

2. **Client Side**:
   - `client/src/pages/Customize.tsx` - Front/back design selection
   - `client/src/components/CartTShirtPreview.tsx` - Multi-side preview with rotation
   - `client/src/components/RealTShirtPreview.tsx` - Full preview in customize page
   - `client/src/pages/Cart.tsx` - Shows custom designs
   - `client/src/components/CartDrawer.tsx` - Shows custom designs
   - `client/src/user/OrderDetail.tsx` - Uses CartTShirtPreview for clean view
   - `client/src/admin/components/orders/OrderDetailModal.tsx` - Uses CartTShirtPreview
   - `client/src/admin/ManageProducts.tsx` - Soft delete management

### Design Decisions

1. **Preview Components**:
   - RealTShirtPreview: Used in customize page for full-size preview
   - CartTShirtPreview: Used in cart, order details for compact view with rotation

2. **Data Structure**:
   ```javascript
   customization: {
     frontDesign: {
       designId: string,
       designImage: string,
       position: string,
       price: number
     },
     backDesign: {
       designId: string,
       designImage: string,
       position: string,
       price: number
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Position Styles**:
   - Consistent positioning across all preview components
   - Positions properly scaled for different preview sizes

### Current Status
Both features are fully implemented and tested. The system now supports:
- Soft deletion of products with analytics preservation
- Multi-side custom t-shirt designs with position selection
- Proper rendering across all order flow components

### Recent Bug Fix (Backend Order Creation)

**Issue**: Order details were showing all products as custom because backend was creating empty `customization` objects for every product.

**Root Cause**: The order controller was adding customization structure even when there was no design data (designId/designImage missing).

**Fix Applied**:
1. Backend now only creates customization objects when actual design data exists
2. Checks for both `designId` AND `designImage` before creating front/back design objects
3. Removes empty customization objects that don't contain any valid design data
4. Regular products no longer get customization fields

**Frontend Adjustments**:
1. Updated CartTShirtPreview to check for actual design images (`customization?.frontDesign?.designImage`)
2. Order detail pages check for design data existence before showing multi-side indicators
3. Both user and admin order views now properly distinguish custom vs normal products

**Result**: Orders now correctly display:
- Normal products show regular product images with links
- Custom products show t-shirt preview with proper design rendering
- Multi-side designs only show rotation controls when actual designs exist

### Complete Data Flow Fix (Frontend to Backend)

**Issue**: Custom t-shirts with front/back designs were losing customization data during order creation.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Cart items in Customize.tsx correctly included customization structure
2. CheckoutFixed.tsx wasn't passing customization field to backend
3. Backend was creating empty customization objects for all products

**Complete Fix Applied**:
1. **Frontend (CheckoutFixed.tsx)**:
   - Added customization to CartItem interface
   - Include customization field when mapping cart items to order products

2. **Backend (order.js & guestOrder.js)**:
   - Process products before saving to validate customization data
   - Only keep customization if has actual design data (designId AND designImage)
   - Remove empty customization objects
   - Prevent regular products from having customization fields

3. **Order Helper**:
   - Updated OrderItem interface to include full customization structure
   - Support for both legacy fields and new multi-design structure

**Data Flow Now**:
1. Customize → Cart: Full customization data preserved
2. Cart → Checkout: Customization passed through
3. Checkout → Backend: Complete product data sent
4. Backend → Database: Validated and cleaned data saved
5. Database → UI: Proper rendering with design details

**Test Files Created**:
- `testNewOrderCreation.js`: Tests order controller validation
- `testCustomizationFlow.js`: Tests complete data flow
