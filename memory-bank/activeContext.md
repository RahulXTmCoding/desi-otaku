**Key Backend Changes**:
- `server/controllers/razorpay.js`: Replaced hardcoded values with AOVService calls

**New Email Features**:
- **Detailed Order Summary**: Shows subtotal, all discount types, shipping, total savings
- **Professional Breakdown**: Color-coded discounts (AOV=yellow, coupon=green, rewards=purple)
- **Complete Transparency**: Customers see exactly how every discount was calculated

**Email Template Now Shows**:
```
Subtotal: ₹1,832
Free Shipping: ₹0
Quantity Discount (20% off for 5 items): -₹366
