# Active Context

## Recently Completed Tasks (January 2025)

### 1. Backend Performance Optimization - Phase 1 ✅
**Completed January 7, 2025**

#### What was done:
1. **Added Database Indexes**:
   - Product model: 11 new indexes for search, filtering, and sorting
   - Order model: 8 new indexes for user lookups, analytics, and tracking
   - Design model: 9 new indexes for browsing and popularity sorting
   - Added `paymentStatus` field to Order model for analytics

2. **Optimized Analytics Controller**:
   - Created `analyticsOptimized.js` using MongoDB aggregation pipelines
   - Implemented 5-minute in-memory caching
   - Replaced JavaScript array operations with database-level aggregations
   - Added parallel query execution with Promise.all

3. **Created Migration Tools**:
   - `addIndexes.js` - Script to add indexes to existing database
   - `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

#### Expected Performance Improvements:
- Product listings: 75-80% faster
- Analytics dashboard: 90% faster (with caching)
- Order searches: 80-90% faster

#### Important: Frontend remains unchanged
All optimizations are backend-only. No frontend modifications required.

### 2. Soft Delete Feature for Products ✅
### 3. Custom Design Data Flow Fix ✅

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete
No active development tasks. System is stable with all features working correctly.

### Recent Implementations

1. **Backend Performance Phase 1**
   - Database indexes optimized for all major query patterns
   - Analytics using MongoDB aggregation instead of JavaScript processing
   - In-memory caching with automatic TTL
   - Backward compatible - no frontend changes needed

2. **Soft Delete for Products**
   - Products have `isDeleted` field (default: false)
   - Admin can soft delete products (marking them as deleted)
   - Soft deleted products remain in database for analytics and order history
   - Admin can view and restore soft deleted products
   - Option for permanent deletion from admin dashboard
   - API endpoints updated to filter out deleted products from public views

3. **Front & Back Custom Design Support**
   - Users can add designs to front, back, or both sides of t-shirts
   - Position selection for each side:
     - Front: center, left chest, right chest, center-bottom
     - Back: center, center-bottom
   - CartTShirtPreview component handles multi-side designs with rotation toggle
   - Design positions render correctly across all components
   - Order details show custom designs with F/B indicators

### Key Components Updated

1. **Server Side**:
   - `server/models/product.js` - Added isDeleted field + performance indexes
   - `server/models/order.js` - Added paymentStatus field + performance indexes
   - `server/models/design.js` - Added performance indexes
   - `server/controllers/analyticsOptimized.js` - NEW: Optimized analytics
   - `server/addIndexes.js` - NEW: Migration script
   - `server/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - NEW: Documentation

2. **Client Side**:
   - No changes in Phase 1 (all optimizations are backend-only)

### Design Decisions

1. **Index Strategy**:
   - Compound indexes for common filter combinations
   - Text indexes for search functionality
   - Single field indexes for sorting operations
   - Careful index ordering for optimal performance

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Simple in-memory Map for analytics caching
   - 5-minute TTL to balance freshness and performance
   - Manual cache clear endpoint for testing

3. **Aggregation Pipelines**:
   - Database-level computations instead of JavaScript
   - Parallel execution of independent queries
   - Efficient grouping and projection

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. Implement lean queries with field selection
2. Add Redis for distributed caching
3. Optimize image handling and CDN integration
4. Consider database connection pooling

### How to Apply Phase 1
1. Run `node addIndexes.js` in server directory
2. Optionally update analytics route to use optimized controller
3. Monitor performance improvements
4. No frontend changes needed!

### Recent Bug Fix (Backend Order Creation)

**Issue**: Order details were showing all products as custom because backend was creating empty `customization` objects for every product.

**Root Cause**: The order controller was adding customization structure even when there was no design data (designId/designImage missing).

**Fix Applied**:
1. Backend now only creates customization objects when actual design data exists
2. Checks for both `designId` AND `designImage` before creating front/back design objects
3. Removes empty customization objects that don't contain any valid design data
4. Regular products no longer get customization fields

**Frontend Adjustments**:
1. Updated CartTShirtPreview to check for actual design images (`customization?.frontDesign?.designImage`)
2. Order detail pages check for design data existence before showing multi-side indicators
3. Both user and admin order views now properly distinguish custom vs normal products

**Result**: Orders now correctly display:
- Normal products show regular product images with links
- Custom products show t-shirt preview with proper design rendering
- Multi-side designs only show rotation controls when actual designs exist

### Complete Data Flow Fix (Frontend to Backend)

**Issue**: Custom t-shirts with front/back designs were losing customization data during order creation.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Cart items in Customize.tsx correctly included customization structure
2. CheckoutFixed.tsx wasn't passing customization field to backend
3. Backend was creating empty customization objects for all products

**Complete Fix Applied**:
1. **Frontend (CheckoutFixed.tsx)**:
   - Added customization to CartItem interface
   - Include customization field when mapping cart items to order products

2. **Backend (order.js & guestOrder.js)**:
   - Process products before saving to validate customization data
   - Only keep customization if has actual design data (designId AND designImage)
   - Remove empty customization objects
   - Prevent regular products from having customization fields

3. **Order Helper**:
   - Updated OrderItem interface to include full customization structure
   - Support for both legacy fields and new multi-design structure

**Data Flow Now**:
1. Customize → Cart: Full customization data preserved
2. Cart → Checkout: Customization passed through
3. Checkout → Backend: Complete product data sent
4. Backend → Database: Validated and cleaned data saved
5. Database → UI: Proper rendering with design details

**Test Files Created**:
- `testNewOrderCreation.js`: Tests order controller validation
- `testCustomizationFlow.js`: Tests complete data flow
