## Current Focus: Multi-Image System Implementation âœ…

### Completed Multi-Image Feature
Successfully implemented and integrated the multi-image upload and display system across the entire application.

#### Key Changes & Fixes:
1.  **Backend**:
    *   Implemented JSON-based endpoints (`/product/create-json`, `/product/update-json`) to handle base64 image uploads.
    *   Increased Express payload limit to 50MB to support larger images.
    *   Switched file storage from GridFS to Cloudinary for better scalability.
    *   The `product` model now uses an `images` array with `url` and `isPrimary` fields.

2.  **Frontend - Product Management**:
    *   **AddProduct.tsx**: Users can now upload multiple images (via file or URL) and select a primary image. The UI was updated to remove misleading text.
    *   **UpdateProduct.tsx**: Correctly loads and displays existing images, respecting the `isPrimary` flag from the database.

3.  **Frontend - Image Display**:
    *   **All Components**: Updated all components that display product images to use the new system. This includes `ProductCard`, `ProductGridItem`, `Cart`, `OrderReview`, `OrderDetail` (user), and admin order details.
    *   **imageHelper.ts**: The central image utility was updated to prioritize the primary image from the `images` array, with fallbacks for legacy products.

### Benefits of the New System:
-   **Full Multi-Image Support**: Admins can add multiple images to any product.
-   **User-Controlled Primary Image**: The primary image is no longer automatically the first one; it's explicitly set by the user.
-   **Consistent Display**: Product images are now displayed correctly and consistently across all user-facing and admin components.
-   **Robust Backend**: The JSON-based API is more flexible and robust for handling complex product data.

## Next Steps
1.  **Code Cleanup**: Remove any remaining unused code related to the old single-image system (e.g., old API routes, unused helper functions).
2.  **Testing**: Perform a full end-to-end test of the product creation, update, and purchase flow to ensure the new image system is working perfectly.
3.  **Documentation**: Ensure all relevant documentation (like `README.md`) is updated to reflect the new image handling process.
4.  **Performance**: Investigate lazy-loading for product images to improve initial page load times, especially on pages with many products.
