- Products sorted by similarity score, then by popularity
- Falls back to popular products if not enough similar ones found
- Uses ProductGridItem component for consistent UI

## Form Validation System

- Validation rules:
  - Email: Valid format check
  - Phone: 10-digit Indian numbers (6-9 prefix)

  - Password: Min 6 chars with letter & number
  - PIN Code: 6 digits, Indian format
  - Address: Min 10 chars
  - City/State: Letters and spaces only
- Real-time validation on blur and change (if touched)
