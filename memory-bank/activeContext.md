# Active Context

## Current Focus: Cart Persistence Complete! âœ…

### Completed Implementation
- **Backend Cart Storage**: MongoDB cart model with full customization support
- **Cart API**: 7 endpoints for cart operations (add, remove, update, merge, etc.)
- **Frontend Integration**: CartProvider wrapping entire app with global state
- **UI Updates**: All components now use CartContext instead of localStorage
- **Import Fixes**: All `cartEmpty` and `loadCart` references replaced with context

### What's Working Now

#### Backend Features
1. Cart persists in MongoDB for logged-in users
2. Guest cart automatically merges on login
3. Full support for custom t-shirt designs (front/back with positions)
4. Cart methods: getTotal, getTotalItems, merge

#### Frontend Integration
1. **CartProvider**: Provides global cart state
2. **CartDrawer**: Shows sync status with cloud icons
3. **Header**: Real-time cart count updates
4. **ProductCard**: Add to cart using context
5. **Cart Pages**: Both routes use new system
6. **Checkout**: Clears cart after order
7. **Signin**: Auto-syncs cart on login

#### Key Benefits
- ðŸ›’ Never lose cart items
- ðŸ”„ Cross-device cart access
- ðŸ“Š Track abandoned carts
- ðŸŽ¯ Better marketing insights
- ðŸš€ Enterprise-level features

### Technical Details
- Context API for state management
- Automatic backend sync for logged users
- LocalStorage fallback for guests
- TypeScript support throughout
- Error handling and loading states

### Next Phase Ready
Geographic Analytics for customer location tracking can now be implemented, building on the user and order data we're already tracking.

## Recent Technical Decisions
1. Used Context API instead of Redux for simplicity
2. Backend sync only for logged-in users (guests use localStorage)
3. Merge strategy: Guest items added to existing cart on login
4. Custom design data structure supports front/back with full transform data

## Important Patterns
- All cart operations go through context
- Backend sync is automatic for logged users
- Guest carts persist in localStorage
- Cart clearing happens after successful order

## Next Steps
1. Geographic analytics implementation
2. Abandoned cart recovery features
3. Cart recommendation engine
4. Multi-currency support
