# Progress

## Current Status (7/11/2025)

### Latest Implementation: Multi-Image System ✅

#### Full Multi-Image Integration (Completed 7/9/2025)
Successfully implemented and integrated the multi-image upload and display system across the entire application. This was a major architectural update.

**Key Features & Fixes:**
-   **Multi-Image Upload**: Admins can now upload multiple images for a single product using either files or URLs.
-   **Primary Image Selection**: The system allows for one image to be marked as `isPrimary`, which is then used as the main display image across the site. This is now fully user-controlled.
-   **Backend Overhaul**:
    *   Switched from `FormData` to a more robust JSON-based API for product creation and updates (`/product/create-json`, `/product/update-json`).
    *   Increased the server's payload limit to 50MB to handle base64-encoded images.
    *   Migrated file storage from MongoDB GridFS to Cloudinary for better performance and scalability.
-   **Frontend Component Updates**:
    *   **AddProduct/UpdateProduct**: Refactored to support multi-image management and primary image selection.
    *   **Cart, OrderReview, OrderDetail (User & Admin)**: All components that display product images have been updated to use the new `images` array and prioritize the primary image.
    *   **imageHelper.ts**: The central utility for getting image URLs was updated to handle the new data structure, ensuring consistent display everywhere.

**Impact:**
-   All known bugs related to product image display have been resolved.
-   The admin experience for managing product images is significantly improved.
-   The new system is more scalable and easier to maintain.

### Previous Implementations
-   **Cart Persistence** ✅
-   **Guest Checkout Flow** ✅
-   **Analytics Dashboard** ✅
-   **Product & Design Management** ✅

### Working Features
All core features are operational, now with robust multi-image support integrated into the product management and ordering flows.

### Known Issues
-   No major known issues at this time. The focus is now on cleanup and preparing for the next phase of development.

### Latest Implementation: Subcategory System ✅ (Completed 7/12/2025)

#### Full Hierarchical Category Implementation
- **Backend Architecture**:
  - Extended Category model with parentCategory, level, slug, icon, and isActive fields
  - Added subcategory field to Product model with proper indexes
  - Created new API endpoints for category hierarchy management
  - Fixed queries to include old categories without new fields

- **Frontend Updates**:
  - Shop page now uses getMainCategories() to show only parent categories
  - Subcategories appear dynamically when main category is selected
  - Admin panel shows hierarchical tree view with expand/collapse
  - AddCategory supports creating both main and subcategories

- **Migration & Fixes**:
  - Created fixCategories.js script for database updates
  - Fixed 400 errors by ensuring unique category names
  - Updated queries to include categories without isActive field

### Previous Implementation: UI/UX Enhancements & Bug Fixes ✅ (Completed 7/11/2025)

#### Responsive Layout Improvements
- **Extended Horizontal Layout**: Replaced `max-w-7xl` with `w-[96%] md:w-[90%]` across all pages for better screen utilization
- **Mobile Cart Experience**: Implemented redirect to cart page on mobile instead of drawer for better UX
- **Complete Responsive Updates**: Made all pages fully responsive including Wishlist, Contact, Auth pages, Dashboard, and modals

#### Smart Product Recommendations
- **"You May Also Like" System**: Created MongoDB aggregation-based similar products API with intelligent scoring:
  - Same category: 50 points
  - Same product type: 30 points
  - Similar price range (±20%): 20 points
  - Matching tags: 10 points per tag (max 30)
  - Name similarity: Up to 20 points
- Falls back to popular products if insufficient similar ones found

#### Form Validation System
- **Comprehensive Validation Utility**: Created `client/src/utils/validation.ts` with rules for:
  - Email format validation
  - Phone: 10-digit Indian numbers (6-9 prefix)
  - Name: Min 2 chars, letters only
  - Password: Min 6 chars with letter & number
  - PIN Code: 6 digits, Indian format
  - Address, City, State validation
- **Real-time Validation**: Applied to all forms with visual feedback
- **Enhanced UX**: Clear error messages with icons, validation on blur/change

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Cart Merge Error**: Fixed validation for empty product IDs during user login
- **Delete Address API**: Fixed endpoint mismatch (singular to plural `/addresses/`)
- **Shop Page Filter Toggle**: Fixed visibility on all screen sizes
- **Modal Overlapping**: Completely redesigned "Surprise Me" modal with proper spacing

### Next Development Phase
1. **Geographic Analytics**
   - Customer location tracking
   - Regional sales insights
   - Shipping optimization

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Database query optimization
   - Image lazy-loading implementation
   - Caching strategies
   - CDN integration for static assets

3. **User Experience**
   - Abandoned cart recovery system
   - Email notification templates
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) features
   - Advanced search and filtering

4. **Code Quality**
   - Increase test coverage
   - API documentation with Swagger
   - Component library documentation
   - Performance monitoring integration

### Technical Debt
- Some components have duplicate code that could be refactored
- Test coverage needs improvement
- Documentation updates needed for new features

### Development Notes
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Context API for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MongoDB with proper indexing
- Express.js backend with JWT auth
