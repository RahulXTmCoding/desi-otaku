## Current Status (7/9/2025)

### Latest Implementation: Multi-Image System ✅

#### Full Multi-Image Integration (Completed 7/9/2025)
Successfully implemented and integrated the multi-image upload and display system across the entire application. This was a major architectural update.

**Key Features & Fixes:**
-   **Multi-Image Upload**: Admins can now upload multiple images for a single product using either files or URLs.
-   **Primary Image Selection**: The system allows for one image to be marked as `isPrimary`, which is then used as the main display image across the site. This is now fully user-controlled.
-   **Backend Overhaul**:
    *   Switched from `FormData` to a more robust JSON-based API for product creation and updates (`/product/create-json`, `/product/update-json`).
    *   Increased the server's payload limit to 50MB to handle base64-encoded images.
    *   Migrated file storage from MongoDB GridFS to Cloudinary for better performance and scalability.
-   **Frontend Component Updates**:
    *   **AddProduct/UpdateProduct**: Refactored to support multi-image management and primary image selection.
    *   **Cart, OrderReview, OrderDetail (User & Admin)**: All components that display product images have been updated to use the new `images` array and prioritize the primary image.
    *   **imageHelper.ts**: The central utility for getting image URLs was updated to handle the new data structure, ensuring consistent display everywhere.

**Impact:**
-   All known bugs related to product image display have been resolved.
-   The admin experience for managing product images is significantly improved.
-   The new system is more scalable and easier to maintain.

### Previous Implementations
-   **Cart Persistence** ✅
-   **Guest Checkout Flow** ✅
-   **Analytics Dashboard** ✅
-   **Product & Design Management** ✅

### Working Features
All core features are operational, now with robust multi-image support integrated into the product management and ordering flows.

### Known Issues
-   No major known issues at this time. The focus is now on cleanup and preparing for the next phase of development.

### Next Development Phase
1.  **Code Cleanup & Refactoring**:
    *   Remove all remnants of the old single-image system (e.g., unused API routes, `photoUrl` fields in interfaces where they are no longer needed).
    *   Standardize TypeScript interfaces across the application.
2.  **End-to-End Testing**:
    *   Perform comprehensive testing of the entire product lifecycle: creation -> adding to cart -> checkout -> order confirmation -> viewing in order history.
3.  **Performance Enhancements**:
    *   Investigate and implement lazy-loading for product images to improve page load performance.
    *   Analyze and optimize database queries, especially for analytics.

### Next Development Phase
1. **Geographic Analytics**
   - Customer location tracking
   - Regional sales insights
   - Shipping optimization

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Database query optimization
   - Image loading improvements
   - Caching strategies

3. **User Experience**
   - Enhanced product recommendations
   - Abandoned cart recovery
   - Email notifications

### Technical Debt
- Some components have duplicate code that could be refactored
- Test coverage needs improvement
- Documentation updates needed for new features

### Development Notes
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Context API for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MongoDB with proper indexing
- Express.js backend with JWT auth
