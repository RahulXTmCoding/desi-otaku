# Anime T-Shirt Brand - Full Stack Web App Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview
**Goal**: Build a complete e-commerce platform for custom anime t-shirt designs with user customization, ordering, payment, and admin management capabilities.

## 1.1 Design System & Visual Identity

### **Core Design Philosophy:**
- **Dark Theme First**: Modern dark UI (#1F2937, #111827, #374151) as primary background
- **Vibrant Accent System**: High-contrast color palette for visual impact and brand differentiation
- **Anime-Inspired Aesthetics**: Playful yet professional design that resonates with anime community
- **Interactive & Engaging**: Hover effects, animations, and micro-interactions throughout

### **Color Palette:**
```css
Primary Colors:
- Background Dark: #1F2937 (gray-800)

- Card Background: #374151 (gray-700)

Accent Colors:
- Primary Yellow: #FCD34D (yellow-400) - CTAs, highlights
- Purple Gradient: #8B5CF6 to #6366F1 (purple-500 to indigo-500)
- Success Green: #10B981 (emerald-500)
- Warning Orange: #F59E0B (amber-500)

Text Colors:
- Primary Text: #FFFFFF (white)

```

### **Typography System:**
```css
Font Family: Inter, system-ui, sans-serif
Headings: 
- H1: 3.5rem/5rem (56px/80px) - Hero titles
- H2: 2.25rem/2.75rem (36px/44px) - Section headers
- H3: 1.5rem/2rem (24px/32px) - Card titles
- H4: 1.25rem/1.75rem (20px/28px) - Subsections

Body Text:

- Regular: 1rem/1.5rem (16px/24px) - Standard content
- Small: 0.875rem/1.25rem (14px/20px) - Meta information
```

### **Component Design Principles:**
1. **Rounded Corners**: Consistent border-radius (8px, 12px, 16px) for modern feel
2. **Glassmorphism Elements**: Subtle backdrop-blur effects on navigation
3. **Gradient Accents**: Used sparingly for hero sections and CTAs
4. **Shadow System**: Layered shadows for depth (hover states, modals)
5. **Smooth Transitions**: 200-300ms transition durations for all interactions

### **Layout & Spacing:**
```css
Container Max-width: 1280px (7xl)
Section Padding: 4rem vertical, 1.5rem horizontal
Card Padding: 1.5rem to 2rem
Grid Gaps: 1.5rem standard, 2rem for larger cards
Border Radius: 0.5rem (8px) to 1.5rem (24px)
```

### **Interactive States:**
- **Hover**: Scale(1.05) transform + color transitions
- **Focus**: Yellow accent ring for accessibility
- **Active**: Slight scale-down (0.95) with color change
- **Loading**: Subtle pulse animations
- **Success**: Green flash with check icons

### **Iconography:**
- **Icon Library**: Lucide React for consistency
- **Sizes**: 16px (small), 20px (regular), 24px (large)
- **Style**: Outline style icons with 2px stroke width
- **Usage**: Functional icons + decorative emojis for anime themes

### **Animation Guidelines:**
