# Discount Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of discount functionality (coupons and reward points) in the checkout flow, with a focus on backend security and validation.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Components

#### 1. DiscountSection Component (`client/src/components/checkout/DiscountSection.tsx`)
- Created a new component for applying discounts
- Features:
  - Coupon code input with validation
  - Reward points redemption (authenticated users only)
  - Real-time discount display
  - Test mode support with mock data

#### 2. CheckoutFixed Updates (`client/src/pages/CheckoutFixed.tsx`)
- Integrated DiscountSection in Step 2 (Review)
- Added order summary showing all discounts
- Updated final amount calculations

#### 3. OrderHandler (`client/src/components/checkout/OrderHandler.tsx`)
- Sends discount data to backend
- Frontend only sends coupon code and reward points count
- No client-side discount calculations for security

### Backend Security Implementation

#### 1. Order Model Updates (`server/models/order.js`)
- Added fields:
  - `originalAmount`: Total before discounts
  - `rewardPointsRedeemed`: Number of points used
  - `rewardPointsDiscount`: Discount amount from points

#### 2. Order Controller (`server/controllers/order.js`)
- **Coupon Validation**:
  - Validates coupon exists and is active
  - Checks expiry dates and usage limits
  - Validates minimum purchase requirements
  - Enforces first-time-only restrictions
  - Checks per-user usage limits
  - Calculates discount server-side (percentage or fixed)
  
- **Reward Points Redemption**:
  - Validates user has sufficient points
  - Redeems points during order creation (atomic operation)
  - Updates reward transaction with order ID
  - Only available for authenticated users
  
- **Coupon Tracking**:
  - Tracks usage after successful order creation
  - Updates coupon usage count and user tracking

#### 3. Guest Order Controller (`server/controllers/guestOrder.js`)
- Updated to handle discount fields
- Guest users can use coupons but not reward points

### Security Features

1. **All validation happens on backend**
   - Frontend cannot manipulate discount amounts
   - Server recalculates all prices and discounts

2. **Atomic operations**
   - Reward points are redeemed as part of order creation
   - No separate API calls that could fail independently

3. **Proper error handling**
   - Returns specific error messages for invalid coupons
   - Handles insufficient reward points gracefully

4. **Audit trail**
   - Coupon usage is tracked with order IDs
   - Reward transactions are linked to orders

## Data Flow

1. User enters coupon code or selects reward points
2. Frontend validates format only (basic checks)
3. On checkout, frontend sends:
   - `coupon: { code, discount, description }` (discount is for display only)
   - `rewardPointsRedeemed: number`
4. Backend:
   - Validates coupon independently
   - Calculates actual discount
   - Validates and redeems reward points
   - Creates order with validated amounts
   - Tracks coupon usage
5. Order confirmation shows applied discounts

## Test Mode
- Mock coupon validation
- Mock reward points balance
- Allows testing without real data

## API Changes
No new endpoints created. Discount handling is integrated into existing order creation flow for better security.

## Future Enhancements
1. Admin interface for coupon management
2. Coupon expiry notifications
3. Reward points expiry system
4. Analytics for discount usage
