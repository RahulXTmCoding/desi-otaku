# Order Detail Fix Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Normal products showing as custom**: All products in orders have a `customization` object (even if empty), which was causing normal products to be detected as custom.

2. **Design images not showing**: Legacy custom orders have design data in `designId`/`designImage` fields, but the new `customization` structure has empty values.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Product Type Detection
- Changed condition from checking if `customization` object exists to checking if it has actual design data
- Custom products are identified by: `!product.product && (isCustom || has design fields)`
- Normal products have a `product` reference field

### 2. CartTShirtPreview Component
- Updated to check for actual design images: `customization?.frontDesign?.designImage`
- Only shows multi-side UI if there are actual design images
- Maintains support for both legacy and new structures

### 3. Order Detail Pages
- Both user and admin pages now properly detect product types
- "Front & Back Design" labels only show when actual design images exist

## Data Structure Observations

### Legacy Custom Orders
```javascript
{
  isCustom: true,
  designId: "68645c1234fb87fcbd9c879e",
  designImage: "http://localhost:8000/api/design/image/68645c1234fb87fcbd9c879e",
  customDesign: "Custom T-Shirt - one piece",
  customization: {
    frontDesign: { designId: undefined, designImage: undefined },
    backDesign: { designId: undefined, designImage: undefined }
  }
}
```

### New Multi-Side Orders (Expected)
```javascript
{
  isCustom: true,
  customization: {
    frontDesign: {
      designId: "xxx",
      designImage: "http://...",
      position: "center",
      price: 150
    },
    backDesign: {
      designId: "yyy",
      designImage: "http://...",
      position: "center",
      price: 150
    }
  }
}
```

## Backend Fix Applied

Fixed the order controller to:
1. Only create `customization` objects when there's actual design data (designId AND designImage)
2. Remove empty customization objects that don't have any design data
3. Prevent normal products from having customization fields

### Key Changes:
- Check for both `designId` AND `designImage` before creating front/back design objects
- Delete the customization object if neither front nor back has valid design data
- Don't add customization field to regular products (those with product references)

## Remaining Tasks:
1. Apply the same validation to guest order controller
2. Test new orders to ensure customization data is properly stored
3. Consider migrating old orders with empty customization objects

## How the Fix Works:

For new orders:
- Normal products: No customization field added
- Custom products with legacy design: Uses designId/designImage fields
- Custom products with front/back: Only stores customization if design data exists

This ensures the UI can properly distinguish between custom and normal products.
