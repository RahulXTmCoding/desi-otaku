# 🏷️ Product MRP-Based Pricing System

## 🎯 Overview

Your anime t-shirt shop now supports **MRP-based pricing** that integrates perfectly with the GST-inclusive invoice system. You can set both MRP and selling price for products, and the system automatically calculates discounts and creates attractive invoices.

## 🆕 Enhanced Product Model

### **Product Pricing Fields**
```javascript
{
  price: 549,           // Selling price (what customer pays)
  mrp: 1149,           // Maximum Retail Price (for display)
  discount: 600,        // Auto-calculated (MRP - Price)
  discountPercentage: 52 // Auto-calculated percentage
}
```

### **Auto-Calculation Features**
- **Discount Amount**: Automatically calculated as `MRP - Price`
- **Discount Percentage**: Automatically calculated as `((MRP - Price) / MRP) × 100`
- **Smart Fallback**: If no MRP set, generates attractive pricing automatically

## 🔢 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Manual MRP Setting**
```
When you create a product:
Price: ₹549
MRP: ₹1149

System automatically calculates:
Discount: ₹600
Discount %: 52%

Website shows: ₹549 (with ₹600 savings)
Invoice shows: MRP-based attractive pricing
```

### **Scenario 2: No MRP Set**
```
When you create a product:
Price: ₹549
MRP: (not set)

System automatically generates:
Discount: ₹274 (based on 1.5x multiplier)
Discount %: 33%

Fallback pricing still creates attractive display
```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Product Model Features**
```javascript
// Auto-calculation on save
productSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  if (this.mrp && this.mrp > 0 && this.price && this.price > 0) {
    this.discount = this.mrp - this.price;
    this.discountPercentage = Math.round((this.discount / this.mrp) * 100);
  } else {
    this.discount = 0;
    this.discountPercentage = 0;
  }
  next();
});

// Helpful methods
product.getPricingDisplay()    // Get complete pricing info
product.getGrossAmount()       // Get MRP or calculated gross
product.getDiscountAmount()    // Get discount amount
product.isDiscounted()         // Check if product has discount
```

### **Invoice Integration**
- Fetches actual product MRP from database
- Uses real discount percentages in invoices
- Creates authentic pricing displays
- Maintains GST-inclusive model

## 💼 How to Create Products

### **Method 1: With MRP (Recommended)**
```javascript
// POST /api/product
{
  "name": "Naruto Hokage T-Shirt",
  "description": "Premium quality anime t-shirt",
  "price": 549,        // Selling price
  "mrp": 1149,        // Maximum Retail Price
  "category": "anime",
  "productType": "t-shirt",
  // ... other fields
}

// Result:
// discount: 600 (auto-calculated)
// discountPercentage: 52 (auto-calculated)
```

### **Method 2: Price Only (Auto-MRP)**
```javascript
// POST /api/product
{
  "name": "One Piece Luffy T-Shirt", 
  "description": "High-quality cotton t-shirt",
  "price": 749,        // Selling price only
  "category": "anime",
  "productType": "t-shirt",
