## 🔧 **COMPREHENSIVE FIX IMPLEMENTED:**

### **Phase 1: Universal Backend Discount Calculator**

**File:** `server/utils/discountCalculator.js`

✅ **Created server-side equivalent** of frontend `OrderDiscountBreakdown` component
✅ **Aggressive online payment detection** - calculates 5% if payment method was online  
✅ **Multiple data source fallbacks** - tries stored data first, calculates if missing
✅ **HTML generation for emails** - consistent formatting across all templates
✅ **Comprehensive logging** - debug info for troubleshooting

**Key Features:**
```javascript
// ✅ AGGRESSIVE DETECTION: Online payment discount
if (onlinePaymentDiscount === 0) {
  const paymentMethod = order.paymentMethod || 'unknown';
  
  if (paymentMethod === 'razorpay' || paymentMethod === 'card' || paymentMethod === 'online') {
    const baseAmount = subtotal - quantityDiscount - couponDiscount - rewardDiscount;
    if (baseAmount > 0) {
      onlinePaymentDiscount = Math.floor(baseAmount * 0.05);
    }
  }
}
```

### **Phase 2: Email Service Fix**

**File:** `server/services/emailService.js`

✅ **Replaced all manual discount calculations** with universal calculator
✅ **Added missing import:** `const DiscountCalculator = require('../utils/discountCalculator');`
✅ **Updated all email templates** to use `DiscountCalculator.generateDiscountHTML(order)`

**Before (Manual Calculation):**
```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN: Manual discount calculations
${order.quantityDiscount && order.quantityDiscount.amount > 0 ? `...` : ''}
${order.coupon && order.coupon.discountValue > 0 ? `...` : ''}
// Missing online payment discount entirely!
```

**After (Universal Calculator):**
```javascript
// ✅ FIXED: Universal discount calculator
${DiscountCalculator.generateDiscountHTML(order)}
// Includes ALL discounts including online payment!
```

### **Phase 3: Invoice Service Fix** 

**File:** `server/services/invoiceService.js`

✅ **Integrated universal calculator** for consistent pricing
✅ **Fixed all variable references** - corrected undefined variables
✅ **Consistent amounts** - invoice totals now match frontend exactly

**Before (Manual Calculation):**
```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN: Manual calculations
const finalPrice = order.amount;
const grossAmount = Math.round(totalGrossAmount);
const finalDiscount = Math.round(grossAmount - finalPrice);
```

**After (Universal Calculator):**
```javascript
// ✅ FIXED: Universal calculator
const discountBreakdown = DiscountCalculator.calculateOrderDiscounts(order);
const grossAmount = discountBreakdown.subtotal + discountBreakdown.shippingCost;
const finalPrice = discountBreakdown.finalAmount;
const totalDiscountApplied = discountBreakdown.totalSavings;
```
