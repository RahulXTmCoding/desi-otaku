# Zero-Downtime Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Overview

Your deployment system implements **Blue-Green Auto Scaling Group Refresh** for zero-downtime deployments. This ensures your application remains available during updates by:

1. **Launching new instances** with updated code
2. **Waiting for health checks** to pass
3. **Gradually shifting traffic** from old to new instances
4. **Terminating old instances** only after new ones are healthy
5. **Maintaining service availability** throughout the process

## 🎯 Enhanced Features

### Zero-Downtime Configuration
```yaml
MinHealthyPercentage: 75%        # Improved from 50%
InstanceWarmup: 10 minutes       # Thorough health checks
Checkpoints: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% # Gradual rollout
CheckpointDelay: 5 minutes       # Safety between stages
```

### Process Flow
```
Old Instances: [A] [B] [C] [D]
                ↓
Stage 1 (25%): [A] [B] [C] [X] ← New instance X launches
                ↓
Stage 2 (50%): [A] [B] [Y] [X] ← New instance Y launches, C terminated
                ↓
Stage 3 (75%): [A] [Z] [Y] [X] ← New instance Z launches, B terminated
                ↓
Stage 4 (100%): [W] [Z] [Y] [X] ← New instance W launches, A terminated
                ↓
Complete: All instances refreshed with zero downtime!
```

## 🔧 Deployment Process

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/production branch** with server changes
- **Manual deployment** via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch

### Steps Performed
1. **Validate secrets** and infrastructure
2. **Update Parameter Store** with latest configuration
3. **Launch instance refresh** with blue-green strategy
4. **Monitor progress** with detailed logging
5. **Validate health** of new deployment
6. **Report success/failure** with comprehensive details

### Monitoring Output
```
🚀 ZERO-DOWNTIME DEPLOYMENT STARTING
🎯 Strategy: Blue-Green Auto Scaling Group Refresh
⏳ [5 min] Progress: 25% | Status: InProgress
📈 Instances: 1 updated, 3 remaining
⏳ [12 min] Progress: 50% | Status: InProgress
📈 Instances: 2 updated, 2 remaining
⏳ [18 min] Progress: 75% | Status: InProgress
📈 Instances: 3 updated, 1 remaining
⏳ [25 min] Progress: 100% | Status: Successful
🎉 ZERO-DOWNTIME DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
✅ All instances refreshed with new code
✅ No service interruption during deployment
✅ 4 healthy instances running
⚡ Total deployment time: 25 minutes
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Automatic Rollback
- **Failed health checks** → Keep old instances running
- **Deployment timeout** → Preserve existing service
- **Instance launch failure** → Maintain current capacity

### Health Validation
- **Load balancer health checks**
- **Application-specific health endpoints**
- **Multiple validation attempts**
- **Timeout protection**

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time progress tracking**
- **Detailed failure reporting**
- **CloudWatch integration**
- **GitHub Actions notifications**

## 📊 Deployment Metrics

### Typical Timeline
- **Preparation**: 2-3 minutes
- **Instance Launch**: 5-8 minutes per stage
- **Health Checks**: 2-3 minutes per instance
- **Total Time**: 20-30 minutes (varies by instance count)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **Zero service interruption**
- ✅ **All health checks pass**
- ✅ **Load balancer traffic maintained**
- ✅ **New code deployed successfully**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Health Check Failures**
   - Check application startup logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure dependencies are available

2. **Instance Launch Problems**
   - Verify launch template configuration
   - Check subnet availability
   - Review security group settings

3. **Timeout Issues**
   - Monitor CloudWatch logs
   - Check instance warmup time
   - Verify scaling group capacity

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Auto Scaling Group status
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-names fashion-backend-production-asg

# Monitor instance refresh progress
aws autoscaling describe-instance-refreshes --auto-scaling-group-name fashion-backend-production-asg

# Check load balancer health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <target-group-arn>

# View application logs
aws logs tail /aws/ec2/fashion-backend --follow
```
