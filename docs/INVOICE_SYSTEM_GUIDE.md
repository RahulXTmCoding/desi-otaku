# Used for invoice PDF links
```

### **2. Puppeteer Configuration**
For production deployment, you may need:
```javascript
// In invoiceService.js for server environments:
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new',
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage'
  ]
});
```

### **3. File Storage**
Ensure PDF storage directory exists:
```bash
mkdir -p server/public/invoices
```

### **4. Serve Static Files**
Already configured in `app.js`:
```javascript
app.use('/invoices', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/invoices')));
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **GST Registration**
When you register for GST:
1. Update `gstNumber` in invoice model
2. Set `isGstApplicable: true`
3. Implement state-wise tax logic
4. Add proper place of supply detection

### **File Storage**
- PDFs are stored in `server/public/invoices/`
- For production, consider cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.)
- Implement file cleanup for old invoices if needed

### **Performance**
- Puppeteer launches browser for each PDF generation
- Consider implementing PDF queue for high volume
- Monitor memory usage in production
