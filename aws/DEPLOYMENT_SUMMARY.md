✅ AWS CLI installed locally
✅ Basic AWS permissions configured
```

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment (10 minutes)
```bash
# Clone your repository and navigate to it
cd your-fashion-backend-repo

# Update CloudFormation template with your VPC/subnet IDs
# Edit: aws/cloudformation/infrastructure.yml

# Deploy infrastructure stack
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name fashion-backend-infrastructure \
  --template-body file://aws/cloudformation/infrastructure.yml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=your-key-name \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region ap-south-1
```

### 2. GitHub Configuration (5 minutes)
```bash
# Add required secrets in GitHub repository settings:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### 3. First Deployment (8 minutes)
```bash
# Push code to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: AWS spot instance deployment"
git push origin main

# Or manually trigger in GitHub Actions tab
```

### 4. Verification (2 minutes)
```bash
# Get your application URL
ALB_DNS=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name fashion-backend-infrastructure \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`LoadBalancerDNS`].OutputValue' \
  --output text --region ap-south-1)

# Test your application
curl "http://$ALB_DNS/health"
echo "🌐 Your fashion backend: http://$ALB_DNS"
```
